My name is Aiden Young

I founded Orpheus AI to bridge the gap of soil science, regenerative farming and precision mapping, allowing farmers to publish their own research on soil health

I am also working on something called Project Seneca, an LLM that trains itself on the syntactical structure of Latin primary sources, as opposed to generic word to word translation
