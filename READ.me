My name is Aiden Young. I am 21 years old and studying Finance at USD.

I founded Orpheus AI to bridge the gap of soil science, regenerative farming, and precision mapping technology, allowing farmers to publish their own research on soil health and run custom biological tests

I am also working on something called "Project Seneca" or SenecaAI, an LLM that trains itself on the syntactical structure of every known Latin primary source, as opposed to generic word to word translator. Essentially teaching AI to understand the structure of the latin language, and translate based on it
