# Aiden Young

My name is Aiden Young. I am 21 years old and studying Finance at USD.

I founded Orpheus AI to bridge the gap of soil science, regenerative farming, LLMs and Soil Data, and precision mapping technology, allowing farmers to publish their own research on soil health and run custom biological tests.

I am also working on something called "Project Seneca" or SenecaAI, an LLM that trains itself on the syntactical structure of every known Latin primary source, as opposed to generic word to word translation. Essentially teaching AI to understand the structure of the latin language.

Why the Soil Matters to You
If it’s grown in America, it’s not organic.
An apple has a quarter of the nutrients it did 50 years ago
